MicroSoft News headline generation (MSNews) is a new News headline generation dataset we collected for GLGE. We random select 151K online news articles from 2012-01-01 to 2020-09-01 from a real-world news search engine. Each article contains a professionally written single-sentence headline. After the pre-processing, there are 151,140 ⟨article, headline⟩ data pairs, where the source input is the news article, and the target output is a news headline.
